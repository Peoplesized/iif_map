The IIF future development depends on providing financial and technical support by the specialized entities and organizations. This does not mean that the Iraqi government does not invest in the field of desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD). The financial requirements and priority projects are usually listed in the plans and budgets of the relevant ministries and are included in the framework of the Iraq development five-year plans. There are pilot initiatives and projects, including but not limited to, the agricultural initiative, the oases, pastures and dunes stabilization project. It is necessary to detail the agricultural initiative given its importance in combating desertification, realizing land reclamation and poverty mitigation. \n\nThe Iraqi government agricultural initiative is a pure national initiative; the Iraqi government did not receive any support from any other sub-regional, regional or international body. An amount of  500 million US Dollars (USD 500,000,000) has been allocated annually for the funding of this initiative: \n• The prime minister has launched this initiative for the agricultural sector development in the second half of the year 2007; \n• This initiative came to seriously contribute to the quick realization of the  sustainable agriculture through the following: \n1- Reforming the agricultural reality; \n2- Realizing the industrial agricultural integration; \n3- Supporting the efforts of the Ministry of Water Resources in its agricultural supporting work and water use rationalization; \n4- Supporting the efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture to develop and promote this sector; and \n5- Providing the cash liquidity necessary for the private sector through specialized lending funds, aiming to develop and invest in agricultural or industrial integrated projects. \n\nAgricultural Initiative Goals: \nThe most important goals of the agricultural initiative is to work towards the realization of food security through the following: \n• Selecting targeted developmental projects of clear tangible impact in both the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Resources to be financed from the amounts allocated to the agricultural initiative for their timely implementation;

\n• Establishing a scientific fact-based national agricultural policy; \n• Rationalizing water use; \n• Stopping the water quality deterioration; \n• Increasing the agricultural production and increasing the food sufficiency ratio; and\n• Enhancing the scientific and professional level of the cadres working in the agricultural sector. \n\nAgricultural Initiative Financial Allocations: \n• An amount of 500 million US Dollars (Equivalent to 600 billion Iraqi Dinars) is allocated annually for the agricultural initiative to be distributed in addition to the allocations made by the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Iraq in their investment methodologies, as follows: \n1- One Hundred and Eighty Eight Million US Dollars (USD 188,000,000): for the implementation of additional projects by the Ministry of Water Resources amounting to (9) important projects that realize the agricultural initiative goals; \n2- Seventy Million US Dollars (USD 70,000,000): for the implementation of additional projects by the Ministry of Agriculture amounting to (24) projects; and\n3- Two Hundred and Forty Million US Dollars (USD 240,000,000): for the specialized lending funds. \n• Total allocations as of 2008 amounted to almost 3 billion US Dollars (USD 3,000,000,000); \n• The Higher Committee for the Agricultural Initiative supported the agricultural education through: \n1- Providing scholarships for post-graduate certificates in the agricultural sector amounting to 130 scholarships to Australia; \n2- Supporting the vocational agricultural education in the Ministry of Education with almost One billion Dinars for the purchasing of educational agricultural equipment and machines; \n3- Supporting and funding the agricultural sector-related scientific conferences;

These measures were developed in view of the positions shared by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of Finance, and contain suggestions received from stakeholders of the Russian Federation. The said set of measures includes implementing actions at the federal and regional levels, building on suggestions coming from the constituent entities of the Russian Federation that have the desertification issue. The first area involves improvement of the regulatory system and development of a scientific and methodological base. The proposed measures include analysing the state, assessing the scale and forecasting the development of the present desertification processes within the Russian Federation. Currently, no integrated assessment of the scale and dynamics of the desertification processes within the Russian Federation exists, since issues of governance related to soil protection have not been assigned to any particular federal executive bodies except agricultural land. The second area involves practical steps to combat soil degradation and desertification within the Russian Federation. Bearing in mind the main factors contributing to the desertification processes, the set of measures includes hydro-technical, erosion-preventive, agroforestal and re-vegetation arrangements and steps to prevent land disposal from agricultural turnover and restore soil fertility. The said measures have been implemented as part of the Federal Target Programme “Preservation and restoration of soil fertility in agricultural land and agrolandscapes as Russia’s national asset in 2006 – 2010 and up to 2013” and as part of regional target programmes. The third area involves honoring the obligations of the Russian Federation related to countering the desertification processes. The set of measures contains activities providing Russia’s fulfillment of its international obligations as a party to the CCD. In addition, the set of measures stipulates encouraging and strengthening international cooperation in combating desertification, as well as implementing L’Aquila Food Security Initiative."

An entire series of recommendations came out of it to define, orient, and frame the measures to be recommended so as to ensure SLM financing. Thus, these recommendations serve to establish the implementation framework, which includes an action plan and a follow-up/evaluation plan. "

As it has already been mentioned in the last National Reports, the National Action Program against Desertification in Spain is an integrating element of a set of measures, most of which are subject to existing plans, programs and policies. This determines that the NAP does not propose the existence of a specific budget fund. The funds for NAP implementation come from the various open funding lines regarding the actions included in the program. The role of the NAP, covered in chapter “Economic Framework for NAP development”, is to promote the funding increase for the most interesting measures and motivate that the available funds are preferably applied on those areas most affected by desertification. Thus, the basic principles in order to finance the fight against desertification lie in the modification and strengthening of existing determined investment lines and in the creation of new lines in certain aspects by providing all of them with the necessary continuity. This adaptation exercise and budgetary reinforcement should be exercised by the elements of the General Administration of the State involved and by the local autonomous Administrations affected by the desertification. The investment lines that are most directly related to the DDTS in Spain were included in the Unified Financial Annex. There are also other investment lines that the National Action Program also considers as elements contributing to fight against DDTS in an indirect way. During the biennium 2012-2013, even though there were no consolidated data on investments for the year 2013, the investment in several of the direct lines to fight against desertification has decreased compared to previous years. This decrease is part of the general decline in public investments in the country as a result of budget adjustments to fight the economic crisis. There have been facts as the fight against wildfires, one of the main causes of land degradation in Spain, in which a great effort to maintain the level of investment has been made."
